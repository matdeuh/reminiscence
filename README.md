# reminiscence
Artistic VR project about souvenir

Reminiscence is a UNITY VR project who work for now with Android Phone and any cardboard or equivalent. This is an alpha version but it allow you to choose old memory ( like an old DCIM folder or your last holliday ) and will show you randomly videos in a VR Univers who go forward and represent time. Any launch will be different beacause they appear randomly and any video will begin with a random frame
